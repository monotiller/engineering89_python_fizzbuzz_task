# FizzBuzz
The classic game now done in python! Includes user input to make the game more personal!

The user gets to select as many numbers as they wish and what they want to call each of them. Then the user will be asked how high they'd like to count to.

Then the program will count from 0 to the user's specified number, checking for multiples of the numbers the user entered!

Give it a go yourself. Comments in the code will walk you through to make things clear.

Enjoy!
